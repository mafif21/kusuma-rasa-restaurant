The concept of IT-based business transactions is called e-business which can affect the process of transactions that are usually conventional (cash) to become digital (cashless).

Simply put, e-business has the same elements as business in general, it's just that all business activities are carried out using an internet basis. According to Charles R. Rieger from IBM, there are five advantages offered by e-business related to aspects of efficiency, effectiveness, reach, structure and opportunity.
